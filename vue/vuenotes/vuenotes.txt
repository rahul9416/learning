what is vue?
vue is javascript framework for building user interface.It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which means it covert the final code in html,javascript and cssit helps developers what they want their code to do, rather than writing step-by-step instructions for how to do it. in vue  developers describe the outcome they desire, and the framework takes care of the details
why SFC 
Pre-compiled templates without runtime compilation cost
###Project Scaffolding (Vue CLI):-
A project scaffold refers to a basic framework or 
structure that provides a starting point for building 
a project. It typically includes the initial files, 
directories, and code necessary to begin a project, 
and may also include some basic functionality and 
configurations.

Project scaffolding can be useful for developers who 
want to save time and reduce the initial setup
 required for a new project. By using a scaffold,
  developers can avoid the repetitive tasks of 
  creating directories, setting up configuration 
  files, and other initial setup steps. Instead, 
  they can focus on the unique aspects of the project 
  and get started on developing the core 
  functionality.
###IDE Support

---------template-syntax----------------------------
template syntax can be thought of as a set of instructions or rules 
that define a structure for generating content 
dynamically. These instructions can include variables, 
conditionals, loops, and filters, which provide a 
flexible way to define a structure that can be used to
generate content based on data from a variety of 
sources.
---------template-syntan-ends--------------------------
---------------*.vue-files aka single-file-component(SFC)------------------
A *.vue file is a custom file format the uses HTML-like describe a portion of the UI 
Each .vue file consists of three types of top-level language blocks
1. <template>The template block is like the HTML of your UI <tenplate/>
2.<script> The script block is where the logic and functionality of your app can be maintained<script/>
3.<style>The CSS block is where you specify the styles related to tha mark up in the template block  <style/>

------------component----------------------------
##basic counter component
//ButtonCounter.vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="count++">
    You clicked me {{ count }} times.
  </button>
</template>
/// App.vue
<script setup>
import ButtonCounter from './ButtonCounter.vue'
</script>

<template>
	<h1>Here are many child components!</h1>
	<ButtonCounter />
	<ButtonCounter />
	<ButtonCounter />
</template>

 each one maintains its own, separate count. That's because each time you use a component, a new instance of it is created.
 

--------------component-ends---------------------
-------------------text interpolation------------------
Text interpolation is a technique used in programming and computer science to insert values or variables into a string of text or a template. This is often used to dynamically generate text or output based on user input or other factors.
Text interpolation in Vue is similar to text interpolation in other programming languages. Vue provides a template syntax that allows you to interpolate data bindings directly into your HTML templates.
in Vue, you can use the {{ }} syntax to enclose the expression or variable you want to interpolate. For example
<script setup>
let name = "userName"
<script/>
<template>
<h1>{{name}}<h1/>// displays the user name or <h1>userName<h1/>
<template/>
we can use it to solve simple expression for e.g.
<template>
<h1>{{2+2}}<h1/>// displays the result or <h1>4<h1/>
<template/>
use simple expression like arthimatics and function calls.If you need to perform more complex operations or calculations in your Vue template, you can use computed properties or methods instead.As text interpolation expressions are executed within the context of the Vue template rendering system, which is optimized for performance and simplicity. Executing complex expressions or functions within this context can lead to performance issues and make your templates harder to understand and maintain.
we can use :-
{{ number + 1 }}

{{ ok ? 'YES' : 'NO' }}

{{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}

<div :id="`list-${id}`"></div>
<span :title="toTitleDate(date)">
  {{ formatDate(date) }}// calling func
</span>
can't :-
<!-- this is a statement, not an expression: -->
{{ var a = 1 }}

<!-- flow control won't work either, use ternary expressions -->
{{ if (ok) { return message } }}

---------directive--starts--------------------
what is directive
Directives are special attributes with the v- prefix.
that provides additional unctionality to HTML elements
directives are used to bind data to an element, manipulate the DOM, or listen to events.

v-bind:- v-bind is a directive that is used to bind an HTML element's attribute to a Vue data property. The v-bind directive is often abbreviated as : for brevity

v-bind:attribute="jsexpression "
v-bind:attribute = "{attribute1:value1,
attribute2,value2}/[attribute1:value1,
attribute2,value2},attribute1:value1,
attribute2,value2}]/string/number"
const objectOfAttrs = {
  id: 'container',
  class: 'wrapper'
}
<div v-bind="objectOfAttrs"></div>
<div> v-bind="{  id: 'container',
  class: 'wrapper'}"
<button :id="submit"><button/>
##v-on directive 
v-on is a directive that is used to attach event listeners to HTML elements. The v-on directive is often abbreviated as @ for brevity(shorthand).
<element v-on:event="methodName"></element>
using shorthand
<element @event="methodName"></element>
Here, event is the name of the DOM event that you want to listen for, such as click, input, keydown, submit, and so on. methodName is the name of the Vue method that you want to call when the event is triggered.

##static args in derectives
<a v-bind:href="url"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a :href="url"> ... </a>
<a v-on:click="doSomething"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a @click="doSomething"> ... </a>
###using dynamic attribute for directives which takes args
<!--
Note that there are some constraints to the argument expression,
as explained in the "Dynamic Argument Value Constraints" and "Dynamic Argument Syntax Constraints" 
-->
<a v-bind:[attributeName]="url"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a :[attributeName]="url"> ... </a>
if your component instance has a data property, attributeName, whose value is "href", then this binding will be equivalent to v-bind:href.
<a v-on:[eventName]="doSomething"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a @[eventName]="doSomething">
In this example, when eventName's value is "focus", v-on:[eventName] will be equivalent to v-on:focus.
###Dynamic Argument Value Constraints
the value of the argument is expected to evaluate to a string, except for the special value null. If the value is not a string or null,  if we were to pass a non-string or non-null value as the argument to v-bind, such as a number or an object, Vue would issue a warning.
<button v-bind:disabled="{ isEnabled }">Click me</button>// warning
###Dynamic Argument Syntax Constraints
HTML attribute names cannot contain certain characters, such as spaces and quotes. Therefore, if you try to use an expression that contains these characters as a dynamic argument, it will be invalid.

<button v-bind:my attribute="value">Click me</button>// invalid as there is a space b/w
<button v-bind:"'my attribute'='value'">Click me</button>// valid used ''(quotes) as a key can't have space to fix it in js we use quote like in objects we do the statement
important to be aware that browsers  automatically converts attribute names to lowercase.. This means that if you use uppercase letters in your attribute names, the browser will automatically convert them to lowercase, which can cause unexpected behavior or errors in your Vue component.
note :-To avoid these issues, it's recommended to use attribute names that are consistently lowercase when working with in-DOM templates in Vue. 
For example, if you have an attribute called "MyAttribute" in your Vue component, you should write it as "myattribute" in your in-DOM template.


------------------------Modifires----------------------
Modifiers are special postfixes denoted by a dot, which indicate that a directive should be bound in some special way. For example, the .prevent modifier tells the v-on directive to call event.preventDefault() on the triggered event:
<form @submit.prevent="onSubmit">...</form>
---------------------Modifires-ends--------------------
----------------------reactivity fundamentals--------------
what is reactive state 
A reactive state refers to a piece of data that is tracked and updated automatically by Vue.js. When a state is marked as reactive, it means that Vue.js will detect any changes made to the state and automatically update any views(means components in UI) that depend on it.
Reactive states are created using the reactive() function from the Vue.js When you create a reactive state using reactive(), Vue.js wraps the state in a JavaScript Proxy object. 

example:-
old way to write code as composition api
import { reactive } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

    function increment() {
      state.count++
    }

    // don't forget to expose the function as well.
    return {
      state,
      increment
    }
  }
}
<template>
</template>
new way to write code as composition api
<script setup>
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

function increment() {
  state.count++
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">
    {{ state.count }}
  </button>
</template>
###DOM Update Timing
When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" in the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.
this mean if something is updated in dom we only can get the last state of dome
###Deep Reactivity
In Vue, state is deeply reactive by default. This means you can expect changes to be detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:
this simply means you can make nested objects that follows reactive state
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const obj = reactive({
  nested: { count: 0 },
  arr: ['foo', 'bar']
})

function mutateDeeply() {
  // these will work as expected.
  obj.nested.count++
  obj.arr.push('baz')
}
###Reactive Proxy vs. Original
proxy object can't be equal to the original as it gets a different memory allocation 
const raw = {}
const proxy = reactive(raw)

// proxy is NOT equal to the original.
console.log(proxy === raw) // false
if you use reactive again on proxy it will point to same proxy in memory 
// calling reactive() on the same object returns the same proxy
console.log(reactive(raw) === proxy) // true

// calling reactive() on a proxy returns itself
console.log(reactive(proxy) === proxy) // true


----------limitation-of-reactive---------------
1.The reactive() API has two limitations:
It only works for object types (objects, arrays, and collection types such as Map and Set). It cannot hold primitive types such as string, number or boolean.
2.
we must always keep the same reference to the reactive object. This means we can't easily "replace" a reactive object because the reactivity connection to the first reference is lost:E.g:-
let state = reactive({ count: 0 })

// the above reference ({ count: 0 }) is no longer being tracked (reactivity connection is lost!)
state = reactive({ count: 1 })
It also means that when we assign or destructure a reactive object's property into local variables, or when we pass that property into a function, we will lose the reactivity connection:
const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

// n is a local variable that is disconnected
// from state.count.
let n = state.count
// does not affect original state
n++

// count is also disconnected from state.count.
let { count } = state
// does not affect original state
count++

// the function receives a plain number and
// won't be able to track changes to state.count
callSomeFunction(state.count)

-----------ref()-----------------------
vue provide ref() To address the limitations of reactive()
A ref containing an object value can reactively replace the entire object:
const objectRef = ref({ count: 0 })

// this works reactively
objectRef.value = { count: 1 }
it means it still have the same memory allocation
Refs can also be passed into functions or destructured from plain objects without losing reactivity:
const obj = {
  foo: ref(1),
  bar: ref(2)
}

// the function receives a ref
// it needs to access the value via .value but it
// will retain the reactivity connection
callSomeFunction(obj.foo)

// still reactive
const { foo, bar } = obj

ref() allows us to create a "reference" to any value and pass it around without losing reactivity.

##global
syntax 
<style>
</style>
we can use classes in other components if it global
but it must be in root component,like if we declare
<style> tag in a component and not inport it to root(App) then it won't work 
note:- if ou want to use css if other component import it to App(root)
if assign any style to child component it will be assinged to the root component 
<template>
<div> // root component 
//more tags
</div>
</template>
##not root
<template>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
</template>
##Scoped
scoped css work only for the component where it is being declared and for the child components of it 
for child component it works same as above like it will only work on root component
## we can declare both scoped and global in a single componet

---------------computed-property-start--------------
what is computed property
Computed property is a feature in Vue.js that allows you to compute and return a new value based on other reactive data in your application. It's like a function that automatically updates whenever the reactive data it depends on changes.
Computed properties are useful for performing complex calculations or deriving values from existing data. They also help keep your code clean and maintainable by separating the calculation logic from the rest of your code.
example :-
let's say you have a list of items in your application and you want to calculate the total price of all the items. Instead of manually iterating through the list and adding up the prices each time the list changes, you can use a computed property to do the calculation for you. The computed property will automatically update the total price whenever the list changes.
###syntax:-
compute{
  function1(){
// usually, we only take two methods in it. getter and setter. these two are used to get value or set value for which we are using these.if needed we can add more function in it to make them also computed.
  }
  let fullName = computed(()=> {})// this will use this function as getter and can be called as fullName()
  let func = computed({  // func is object of computed methods can be called as func.print()
    get(){

    },
    set(){                

    },
    print(){

    }
})
}
### example
<template>
    <div>
      <input v-bind:maxlength="20" type="text" v-model="input.name" />//input feild with maxlength20
      <textarea v-model="input.des" maxlength="5"></textarea>
      <p>{{ computedValue}}/20</p> input letter count
      <h1>{{ input }}</h1>/input
    </div>
</template>
  
<script setup>
  import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
  
  const input = ref({
    name : "",
    des : ""
  });

  const computedValue = computed(() => input.value.name.length);

### difference between computed and methods
Caching: Computed properties are cached based on their dependencies. This means that if a computed property's dependencies have not changed, Vue will return the previously computed value without re-evaluating the property's function. In contrast, methods are not cached and will always be re-evaluated when they are called.
suppose in template tag you are using fullName again and again .example
<template>
<h1>fullName</h1>//computed
<h1>fullName()</h1>//method call
<h1>fullName</h1>//computed
<h1>fullName()</h1>//method call
<h1>fullName</h1>//computed
<h1>fullName()</h1>//method call
for computem it compute only once but for methods in compute it again and again 
###
donts
 computed properties are read-only and should not be directly modified. Instead, you should update the source state that they depend on to trigger new computations and generate new snapshots.
 It is important to remember that computed getter functions should only perform pure computation and be free of side effects(if a computed property makes a network request to fetch some data or modifies the state of some external system, it would be considered to have side effects.). For example, don't make async requests or mutate the DOM inside a computed getter!
</template>

--------------computed-property-end-----
-------------giving class to html element-using v-bind--------
 <div v-bind:class="'className'">
###we can use a array also to give multiple class name 
let clas = ['class1', 'class2']
const activeClass = ref('active')
const errorClass = ref('text-danger')
<div :class="[activeClass, errorClass]"></div>
<div class="active text-danger"></div>
<div :class="[isActive ? activeClass : '', errorClass]"></div>
<div :class="[{ active: isActive }, errorClass]"></div>
<template>
 <div :class="clas">
</template>
assigning class using variable
let clas = 'class1'
<div :class="clas">
##conditional class 
<div :class="{ active: isActive }"></div>
here if isActive is true then active class will be assigned to div
we can give multiple condition classes
const isActive = ref(true)
const hasError = ref(false)
<div
  class="static"
  :class="{ active: isActive, 'text-danger': hasError }"
></div>
const classObject = reactive({
  active: true,
  'text-danger': false
})
<div :class="classObject"></div>
 We can also bind to a computed property that returns an object. This is a common and powerful pattern:
 const isActive = ref(true)
const error = ref(null)

const classObject = computed(() => ({
  active: isActive.value && !error.value,
  'text-danger': error.value && error.value.type === 'fatal'
}))
<div :class="classObject"></div>
Binding Inline Styles​
Binding to Objects​
:style supports binding to JavaScript object values - it corresponds to an HTML element's style property:

js
const activeColor = ref('red')
const fontSize = ref(30)
template
<div :style="{ color: activeColor, fontSize: fontSize + 'px' }"></div>
Although camelCase keys are recommended, :style also supports kebab-cased CSS property keys (corresponds to how they are used in actual CSS) - for example:

template
<div :style="{ 'font-size': fontSize + 'px' }"></div>
It is often a good idea to bind to a style object directly so that the template is cleaner:

js
const styleObject = reactive({
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: '13px'
})
template
<div :style="styleObject"></div>
Again, object style binding is often used in conjunction with computed properties that return objects.
We can bind :style to an array of multiple style objects. These objects will be merged and applied to the same element:
###Extra 
When you use a CSS property that requires a vendor prefix in :style, Vue will automatically add the appropriate prefix. Vue does this by checking at runtime to see which style properties are supported in the current browser. If the browser doesn't support a particular property then various prefixed variants will be tested to try to find one that is supported.

Multiple Values​
You can provide an array of multiple (prefixed) values to a style property, for example:

template
<div :style="{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }"></div>
This will only render the last value in the array which the browser supports. In this example, it will render display: flex for browsers that support the unprefixed version of flexbox.
template
<div :style="[baseStyles, overridingStyles]"></div>
##########NOTE:-

-------------class attribute end---------
--------slot-----------------------------------------
 slots are a way to pass content from a parent component to a child component. They allow the parent component to define a placeholder for content that can be filled by the child component.You can then pass any data to the slot, such as text, numbers, arrays, objects, or even components.
 ## child SlotComponent
 <template>
<h1>hi</h1>
<h2>from</h2>
<slot></slot>//The <slot> element is a slot outlet that indicates where the parent-provided slot content should be rendered.
</template>
##parent App.vue
<template>
<SlotComponent>
<h3> slot</h3>// this will pass the to child as <h3> slot</h3>
</SlotComponent>
</template>
<script setup>
import SlotComponent from "./components/SlotComponent.vue"
### passing other component 
<SlotComponent>
<h3> slot</h3>// this will pass the to child as <h3> slot</h3>
</SlotComponent>
<NewComponent /> // 
</script>


##scope 
Expressions in the parent template only have access to the parent scope; expressions in the child template only have access to the child scope.
same as JavaScript's lexical scoping
Slot content has access to the data scope of the parent component, because it is defined in the parent.
means we can access data from parent but can't use data from child component 
e.g:-
// child SlotComponent 
<template>

<h1>hi</h1>
<h2>from</h2>
<slot>{{ name}}</slot> // can't do this as it is not in scope of slot
</template>
<script setup>
let name = "childData"
</script>
##named slots
There are times when it's useful to have multiple slot outlets in a single component.
this concept allow to give multiple slot in a single component
//child SlotComponent<template>

<h1>hi</h1>
<h2>from</h2>
<slot  name="header">
<h3>Default value</h3>
</slot>
<slot>
    <h1>default value1</h1>
</slot>
<slot>
    <h1>default value2</h1>
</slot>
<slot name="footer"></slot>
</template>
//parent app.vue
<template>
<SlotComponent>
<template v-slot:header>
<h1>hi from header</h1>
</template>
<h1>hi from slot with name and default name </h1> 
<h2>testing implicite slot</h2><!--this is taking the given data implicitly-->
<template #footer>     <!--short way to write v-slot-->
<h1>hi from footer</h1>
</template>

</SlotComponent>
</template>
<script setup>
import SlotComponent from "./components/SlotComponent.vue"

</script>

when we give slot with name and pass some data to it 
it implicitly  pass it to all the slots in child component in above example we have to slot without name to see run slot in vue folder

### working in javascript of slot named
// passing multiple slot fragments with different names
BaseLayout({
  header: `...`,
  default: `...`,
  footer: `...`
})

// <BaseLayout> renders them in different places
function BaseLayout(slots) {
  return `<div class="container">
      <header>${slots.header}</header>
      <main>${slots.default}</main>
      <footer>${slots.footer}</footer>
    </div>`
}
## scoped slots

-----------------lifecyclehooks---------------------------
Lifecycle hooks in Vue are used to register callback functions that get called at specific points in thelifecycle of a Vue component.
lifecycle hooks can't be used asynchronously This means that the lifecycle hooks should be defined and registered at the same time that the component is being created.
##onMounted
the onMounted hook is used to register a callback function that will be executed after the component has been mounted.(after rendered)
Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework that allows developers to build reactive and dynamic web applications. One of its most powerful features is its lifecycle hooks. Lifecycle hooks are functions that get called at specific stages of a component's lifecycle, allowing developers to perform actions and manipulate data at those points.

There are eight lifecycle hooks in Vue.js, divided into four categories: creation, mounting, updating, and destruction. In this article, we will explain each hook and provide examples to illustrate their usage.

Creation Hooks
Creation hooks are called when a component is first created. They are useful for initializing data, setting up watchers, and other setup tasks.

beforeCreate
The beforeCreate hook is called before the component is created. At this point, the component's data and events have not been initialized, and the template has not been compiled. This hook is useful for setting up any data or services that the component needs before it is created.

Example:

export default {
  beforeCreate() {
    console.log('Component is about to be created');
  }
}
created
The created hook is called after the component is created. At this point, the component's data and events have been initialized, but the template has not been mounted to the DOM. This hook is useful for performing any initial setup tasks that require access to the component's data.

Example:

export default {
  created() {
    console.log('Component has been created');
  }
}

Mounting Hooks
Mounting hooks are called when a component is mounted to the DOM. They are useful for performing tasks that require access to the DOM, such as setting up event listeners or fetching data from an API.

beforeMount
The beforeMount hook is called before the component is mounted to the DOM. At this point, the component's template has been compiled, but it has not yet been added to the DOM. This hook is useful for performing any setup tasks that require access to the component's template.

Example:

export default {
  beforeMount() {
    console.log('Component is about to be mounted');
  }
}
mounted
The mounted hook is called after the component is mounted to the DOM. At this point, the component's template has been added to the DOM, and it is now visible to the user. This hook is useful for performing any tasks that require access to the DOM, such as setting up event listeners or fetching data from an API.

Example:

export default {
  mounted() {
    console.log('Component has been mounted');
  }
}
Updating Hooks
Updating hooks are called when a component's data changes. They are useful for performing tasks that need to be updated whenever the component's data changes.

beforeUpdate
The beforeUpdate hook is called before a component's data changes. At this point, the component's data has been updated, but the DOM has not yet been re-rendered. This hook is useful for performing any tasks that need to be updated before the DOM is re-rendered.

Example:

export default {
  beforeUpdate() {
    console.log('Component is about to be updated');
  }
}
updated
The updated hook is called after a component's data changes. At this point, the component's data has been updated, and the DOM has been re-rendered. This hook is useful for performing any tasks that need to be updated after the DOM has been re-rendered.

Example:

export default {
  updated() {
    console.log('Component has been updated');
  }
}
Destruction Hooks
Destruction hooks are called when a component is destroyed. They are useful for performing cleanup tasks, such as

##component registration
a component needs to be registered first so that vue can locate its implementation when it is encountered in a template
we have two ways to register a component
global and local 
## global
Globally registered components can be used in the template of any component within this application
in sfc we need to first import the component/components to main.js file
import MyComponent from './App.vue'
than we use component function to register the component 
app.component('MyComponent', MyComponent)
to register multiple components we can chain component function
app
  .component('ComponentA', ComponentA)
  .component('ComponentB', ComponentB)
  .component('ComponentC', ComponentC)
if component is registered Globally then we can also use its child as child also get registered globally and can be used in any sfc with using import 
 ##drawbacks of globally registering the components
Global registration prevents build systems from removing unused components
If you globally register a component but end up not using it anywhere in your app, it will still be included in the final bundle.

##local registtration
to register the component locally you need to import it in any component
<script setup>  
import MyComponent from "./components/MyComponent"
<script>
<template> 
<MyComponent />
</template>
we ca use kebabcase and pascalcase  both 
ue supports resolving kebab-case tags to components registered using PascalCase. This means a component registered as MyComponent can be referenced in the template via both <MyComponent> and <my-component>. This allows us to use the same JavaScript component registration code regardless of template source.
##properties(props)
// props declaration
props can be declared using defineProps() macro
<script setup>
const props = defineProps(['foo'])// can define types in this

console.log(props.foo)
//using object to difine props. you can also define the typeof/default value/require props 
defineProps({
  title: String,
  likes: Number  // this only warn in console 
})
</script>
we declare props in child component where it will be used.
//PropsTest child
<template>
<h1>{{ foo }}</h1>
</template>
<script setup>
import {defineProps} from 'vue'
const props = defineProps(['foo'])

console.log(props.foo)
</script>
// parent app.vue
<template>

<Props foo="first prop"/>
<Props foo=" second prop"/>
<props foo=" third prop" />

</template>
<script setup>
// props
import Props from "./components/PropsTest.vue"
</script>
## static props
we provide static values just by using simple key what we declared in child component 
//PropsTest child
<template>
<h1>{{ foo }}</h1>
</template>
<script setup>
import {defineProps} from 'vue'
const props = defineProps(['foo']) // isse use karre gye parent me prop pass karne ke liye

console.log(props.foo)
</script>
// parent app.vue
<template>

<Props foo="first prop"/>
<Props foo=" second prop"/>
<props foo=" third prop" />

</template>
<script setup>
// props
import Props from "./components/PropsTest.vue"
</script>
## dynamic props
we use v-bind to pass any type of data excluded string 
we can also pass strings using v-bine
<Props :foo="'string'" />
## binding multiple props
we can use object to bind multiple props
e.g
const post = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'My Journey with Vue'
}
<props v-bind ="post" />
 equivalent to 
 <props :id="post.id" :title="post.title" />
 ##one way data flow
we should not mutate value of prps in child component as it affects the parent component state
it also affect the value of the
