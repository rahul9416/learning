what is vue?
vue is javascript framework for building user interface.It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which means it covert the final code in html,javascript and cssit helps developers what they want their code to do, rather than writing step-by-step instructions for how to do it. in vue  developers describe the outcome they desire, and the framework takes care of the details
why SFC 
Pre-compiled templates without runtime compilation cost
###Project Scaffolding (Vue CLI):-
A project scaffold refers to a basic framework or 
structure that provides a starting point for building 
a project. It typically includes the initial files, 
directories, and code necessary to begin a project, 
and may also include some basic functionality and 
configurations.

Project scaffolding can be useful for developers who 
want to save time and reduce the initial setup
 required for a new project. By using a scaffold,
  developers can avoid the repetitive tasks of 
  creating directories, setting up configuration 
  files, and other initial setup steps. Instead, 
  they can focus on the unique aspects of the project 
  and get started on developing the core 
  functionality.

---------template-syntax----------------------------
template syntax can be thought of as a set of instructions or rules 
that define a structure for generating content 
dynamically. These instructions can include variables, 
conditionals, loops, and filters, which provide a 
flexible way to define a structure that can be used to
generate content based on data from a variety of 
sources.
---------template-syntan-ends--------------------------
---------------*.vue-files aka single-file-component(SFC)------------------
A *.vue file is a custom file format the uses HTML-like describe a portion of the UI 
Each .vue file consists of three types of top-level language blocks
1. <template>The template block is like the HTML of your UI <tenplate/>
2.<script> The script block is where the logic and functionality of your app can be maintained<script/>
3.<style>The CSS block is where you specify the styles related to tha mark up in the template block  <style/>
----------------SFC-ends-------------------------------
-------------------text interpolation------------------
Text interpolation is a technique used in programming and computer science to insert values or variables into a string of text or a template. This is often used to dynamically generate text or output based on user input or other factors.
Text interpolation in Vue is similar to text interpolation in other programming languages. Vue provides a template syntax that allows you to interpolate data bindings directly into your HTML templates.
in Vue, you can use the {{ }} syntax to enclose the expression or variable you want to interpolate. For example
<script setup>
let name = "userName"
<script/>
<template>
<h1>{{name}}<h1/>// displays the user name or <h1>userName<h1/>
<template/>
we can use it to solve simple expression for e.g.
<template>
<h1>{{2+2}}<h1/>// displays the result or <h1>4<h1/>
<template/>
use simple expression like arthimatics and function calls.If you need to perform more complex operations or calculations in your Vue template, you can use computed properties or methods instead.As text interpolation expressions are executed within the context of the Vue template rendering system, which is optimized for performance and simplicity. Executing complex expressions or functions within this context can lead to performance issues and make your templates harder to understand and maintain.
we can use :-
{{ number + 1 }}

{{ ok ? 'YES' : 'NO' }}

{{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}

<div :id="`list-${id}`"></div>
<span :title="toTitleDate(date)">
  {{ formatDate(date) }}// calling func
</span>
can't :-
<!-- this is a statement, not an expression: -->
{{ var a = 1 }}

<!-- flow control won't work either, use ternary expressions -->
{{ if (ok) { return message } }}

---------directive--starts--------------------
what is directive
Directives are special attributes with the v- prefix.
that provides additional unctionality to HTML elements
directives are used to bind data to an element, manipulate the DOM, or listen to events.

v-bind:- v-bind is a directive that is used to bind an HTML element's attribute to a Vue data property. The v-bind directive is often abbreviated as : for brevity

v-bind:attribute="jsexpression "
v-bind:attribute = "{attribute1:value1,
attribute2,value2}/[attribute1:value1,
attribute2,value2},attribute1:value1,
attribute2,value2}]/string/number"
const objectOfAttrs = {
  id: 'container',
  class: 'wrapper'
}
<div v-bind="objectOfAttrs"></div>
<div> v-bind="{  id: 'container',
  class: 'wrapper'}"
<button :id="submit"><button/>
##v-on directive 
v-on is a directive that is used to attach event listeners to HTML elements. The v-on directive is often abbreviated as @ for brevity(shorthand).
<element v-on:event="methodName"></element>
using shorthand
<element @event="methodName"></element>
Here, event is the name of the DOM event that you want to listen for, such as click, input, keydown, submit, and so on. methodName is the name of the Vue method that you want to call when the event is triggered.

##static args in derectives
<a v-bind:href="url"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a :href="url"> ... </a>
<a v-on:click="doSomething"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a @click="doSomething"> ... </a>
###using dynamic attribute for directives which takes args
<!--
Note that there are some constraints to the argument expression,
as explained in the "Dynamic Argument Value Constraints" and "Dynamic Argument Syntax Constraints" 
-->
<a v-bind:[attributeName]="url"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a :[attributeName]="url"> ... </a>
if your component instance has a data property, attributeName, whose value is "href", then this binding will be equivalent to v-bind:href.
<a v-on:[eventName]="doSomething"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a @[eventName]="doSomething">
In this example, when eventName's value is "focus", v-on:[eventName] will be equivalent to v-on:focus.
###Dynamic Argument Value Constraints
the value of the argument is expected to evaluate to a string, except for the special value null. If the value is not a string or null,  if we were to pass a non-string or non-null value as the argument to v-bind, such as a number or an object, Vue would issue a warning.
<button v-bind:disabled="{ isEnabled }">Click me</button>// warning
###Dynamic Argument Syntax Constraints
HTML attribute names cannot contain certain characters, such as spaces and quotes. Therefore, if you try to use an expression that contains these characters as a dynamic argument, it will be invalid.

<button v-bind:my attribute="value">Click me</button>// invalid as there is a space b/w
<button v-bind:"'my attribute'='value'">Click me</button>// valid used ''(quotes) as a key can't have space to fix it in js we use quote like in objects we do the statement
important to be aware that browsers  automatically converts attribute names to lowercase.. This means that if you use uppercase letters in your attribute names, the browser will automatically convert them to lowercase, which can cause unexpected behavior or errors in your Vue component.
note :-To avoid these issues, it's recommended to use attribute names that are consistently lowercase when working with in-DOM templates in Vue. 
For example, if you have an attribute called "MyAttribute" in your Vue component, you should write it as "myattribute" in your in-DOM template.


------------------------Modifires----------------------
Modifiers are special postfixes denoted by a dot, which indicate that a directive should be bound in some special way. For example, the .prevent modifier tells the v-on directive to call event.preventDefault() on the triggered event:
<form @submit.prevent="onSubmit">...</form>
---------------------Modifires-ends--------------------
----------------------reactivity fundamentals--------------
what is reactive state 
A reactive state refers to a piece of data that is tracked and updated automatically by Vue.js. When a state is marked as reactive, it means that Vue.js will detect any changes made to the state and automatically update any views(means components in UI) that depend on it.
Reactive states are created using the reactive() function from the Vue.js When you create a reactive state using reactive(), Vue.js wraps the state in a JavaScript Proxy object. 

example:-
old way to write code as composition api
import { reactive } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

    function increment() {
      state.count++
    }

    // don't forget to expose the function as well.
    return {
      state,
      increment
    }
  }
}
<template>
</template>
new way to write code as composition api
<script setup>
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

function increment() {
  state.count++
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">
    {{ state.count }}
  </button>
</template>
###DOM Update Timing
When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" in the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.
this mean if something is updated in dom we only can get the last state of dome
###Deep Reactivity
In Vue, state is deeply reactive by default. This means you can expect changes to be detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:
this simply means you can make nested objects that follows reactive state
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const obj = reactive({
  nested: { count: 0 },
  arr: ['foo', 'bar']
})

function mutateDeeply() {
  // these will work as expected.
  obj.nested.count++
  obj.arr.push('baz')
}
###Reactive Proxy vs. Original
proxy object can't be equal to the original as it gets a different memory allocation 
const raw = {}
const proxy = reactive(raw)

// proxy is NOT equal to the original.
console.log(proxy === raw) // false
if you use reactive again on proxy it will point to same proxy in memory 
// calling reactive() on the same object returns the same proxy
console.log(reactive(raw) === proxy) // true

// calling reactive() on a proxy returns itself
console.log(reactive(proxy) === proxy) // true


----------limitation-of-reactive---------------
1.The reactive() API has two limitations:
It only works for object types (objects, arrays, and collection types such as Map and Set). It cannot hold primitive types such as string, number or boolean.
2.
we must always keep the same reference to the reactive object. This means we can't easily "replace" a reactive object because the reactivity connection to the first reference is lost:E.g:-
let state = reactive({ count: 0 })

// the above reference ({ count: 0 }) is no longer being tracked (reactivity connection is lost!)
state = reactive({ count: 1 })
It also means that when we assign or destructure a reactive object's property into local variables, or when we pass that property into a function, we will lose the reactivity connection:
const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

// n is a local variable that is disconnected
// from state.count.
let n = state.count
// does not affect original state
n++

// count is also disconnected from state.count.
let { count } = state
// does not affect original state
count++

// the function receives a plain number and
// won't be able to track changes to state.count
callSomeFunction(state.count)

-----------ref()-----------------------
vue provide ref() To address the limitations of reactive()
A ref containing an object value can reactively replace the entire object:
const objectRef = ref({ count: 0 })

// this works reactively
objectRef.value = { count: 1 }
it means it still have the same memory allocation
Refs can also be passed into functions or destructured from plain objects without losing reactivity:
const obj = {
  foo: ref(1),
  bar: ref(2)
}

// the function receives a ref
// it needs to access the value via .value but it
// will retain the reactivity connection
callSomeFunction(obj.foo)

// still reactive
const { foo, bar } = obj

ref() allows us to create a "reference" to any value and pass it around without losing reactivity.
------------reactivity ends------------
-----------------------methods---------------
// Without Ref
let firstname "Sonam"
let lastname = "Sharma"
function fullName () {
return firstname +“” + lastname
}
const fullName = () (=> {
return firstname + " " + lastname
}
// With Ref
let firstname = ref(“Sonam”)
let lastname = ref("Sharma")
function fullName () {
return firstname.value +“99 + lastname.value
}
const fullName = () · => {
return firstname.value +“ 99 + lastname
}
-----------------methids--end--------------
---------------computed-property-start--------------
what is computed property
Computed property is a feature in Vue.js that allows you to compute and return a new value based on other reactive data in your application. It's like a function that automatically updates whenever the reactive data it depends on changes.
Computed properties are useful for performing complex calculations or deriving values from existing data. They also help keep your code clean and maintainable by separating the calculation logic from the rest of your code.
example :-
let's say you have a list of items in your application and you want to calculate the total price of all the items. Instead of manually iterating through the list and adding up the prices each time the list changes, you can use a computed property to do the calculation for you. The computed property will automatically update the total price whenever the list changes.
###syntax:-
compute{
  function1(){
// usually, we only take two methods in it. getter and setter. these two are used to get value or set value for which we are using these.if needed we can add more function in it to make them also computed.
  }
  let fullName = computed(()=> {})// this will use this function as getter and can be called as fullName()
  let func = computed({  // func is object of computed methods can be called as func.print()
    get(){

    },
    set(){                

    },
    print(){

    }
})
}
### example
<template>
    <div>
      <input v-bind:maxlength="20" type="text" v-model="input.name" />//input feild with maxlength20
      <textarea v-model="input.des" maxlength="5"></textarea>
      <p>{{ computedValue}}/20</p> input letter count
      <h1>{{ input }}</h1>/input
    </div>
</template>
  
<script setup>
  import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
  
  const input = ref({
    name : "",
    des : ""
  });

  const computedValue = computed(() => input.value.name.length);



</script>
## without ref()
<template>
    <div>
      <input v-bind:maxlength="20" type="text" v-model="input.name" />
      <textarea v-model="input.des" maxlength="5"></textarea>
      <p>{{ computedValue}}/20</p>//always remain 0/20
      <p>{{ computedValue }}</p>
      <h1>{{ input }}</h1>
    </div>
</template>
  
<script setup>
  import { computed } from 'vue'
  
  const input = {
    name : "",
    des : ""
  };

  const computedValue = computed(() => input.name.length);
  won't update the value of lentg 



</script>
### difference between computed and methods
Caching: Computed properties are cached based on their dependencies. This means that if a computed property's dependencies have not changed, Vue will return the previously computed value without re-evaluating the property's function. In contrast, methods are not cached and will always be re-evaluated when they are called.
suppose in template tag you are using fullName again and again .example
<template>
<h1>fullName</h1>//computed
<h1>fullName()</h1>//method call
<h1>fullName</h1>//computed
<h1>fullName()</h1>//method call
<h1>fullName</h1>//computed
<h1>fullName()</h1>//method call
for computem it compute only once but for methods in compute it again and again 
###
donts
 computed properties are read-only and should not be directly modified. Instead, you should update the source state that they depend on to trigger new computations and generate new snapshots.
 It is important to remember that computed getter functions should only perform pure computation and be free of side effects(if a computed property makes a network request to fetch some data or modifies the state of some external system, it would be considered to have side effects.). For example, don't make async requests or mutate the DOM inside a computed getter!
</template>

--------------computed-property-end-----
-------------giving class to html element-using v-bind--------
 <div v-bind:class="'className'">
###we can use a array also to give multiple class name 
let clas = ['class1', 'class2']
const activeClass = ref('active')
const errorClass = ref('text-danger')
<div :class="[activeClass, errorClass]"></div>
<div class="active text-danger"></div>
<div :class="[isActive ? activeClass : '', errorClass]"></div>
<div :class="[{ active: isActive }, errorClass]"></div>
<template>
 <div :class="clas">
</template>
assigning class using variable
let clas = 'class1'
<div :class="clas">
##conditional class 
<div :class="{ active: isActive }"></div>
here if isActive is true then active class will be assigned to div
we can give multiple condition classes
const isActive = ref(true)
const hasError = ref(false)
<div
  class="static"
  :class="{ active: isActive, 'text-danger': hasError }"
></div>
const classObject = reactive({
  active: true,
  'text-danger': false
})
<div :class="classObject"></div>
 We can also bind to a computed property that returns an object. This is a common and powerful pattern:
 const isActive = ref(true)
const error = ref(null)

const classObject = computed(() => ({
  active: isActive.value && !error.value,
  'text-danger': error.value && error.value.type === 'fatal'
}))
<div :class="classObject"></div>
Binding Inline Styles​
Binding to Objects​
:style supports binding to JavaScript object values - it corresponds to an HTML element's style property:

js
const activeColor = ref('red')
const fontSize = ref(30)
template
<div :style="{ color: activeColor, fontSize: fontSize + 'px' }"></div>
Although camelCase keys are recommended, :style also supports kebab-cased CSS property keys (corresponds to how they are used in actual CSS) - for example:

template
<div :style="{ 'font-size': fontSize + 'px' }"></div>
It is often a good idea to bind to a style object directly so that the template is cleaner:

js
const styleObject = reactive({
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: '13px'
})
template
<div :style="styleObject"></div>
Again, object style binding is often used in conjunction with computed properties that return objects.
We can bind :style to an array of multiple style objects. These objects will be merged and applied to the same element:
###Extra 
When you use a CSS property that requires a vendor prefix in :style, Vue will automatically add the appropriate prefix. Vue does this by checking at runtime to see which style properties are supported in the current browser. If the browser doesn't support a particular property then various prefixed variants will be tested to try to find one that is supported.

Multiple Values​
You can provide an array of multiple (prefixed) values to a style property, for example:

template
<div :style="{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }"></div>
This will only render the last value in the array which the browser supports. In this example, it will render display: flex for browsers that support the unprefixed version of flexbox.
template
<div :style="[baseStyles, overridingStyles]"></div>
