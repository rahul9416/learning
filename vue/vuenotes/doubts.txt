how to use both in same tag

In addition, type can also be a custom class or constructor function and the assertion will be made with an instanceof check. For example, given the following class:

js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }
}
You could use it as a prop's type:

js
defineProps({
  author: Person
})
Vue will use instanceof Person to validate whether the value of the author prop is indeed an instance of the Person class.
