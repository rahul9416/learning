###Project Scaffolding (Vue CLI):-
A project scaffold refers to a basic framework or 
structure that provides a starting point for building 
a project. It typically includes the initial files, 
directories, and code necessary to begin a project, 
and may also include some basic functionality and 
configurations.

Project scaffolding can be useful for developers who 
want to save time and reduce the initial setup
 required for a new project. By using a scaffold,
  developers can avoid the repetitive tasks of 
  creating directories, setting up configuration 
  files, and other initial setup steps. Instead, 
  they can focus on the unique aspects of the project 
  and get started on developing the core 
  functionality.
