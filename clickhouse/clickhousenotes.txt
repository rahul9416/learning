Row-Oriented Database
Tables are stored as rows in disk
A single block io read to the table fetches multiple rows
with all their columns.
More IOs are required to find a particular row in a table
scan but once you find the row you get all columns for that
row.
Column_Oriented Database
Tables are sorted as columns first in disk
a single block io read to the table fetches multiple columns with all matching rows
less IOs are required to get more values of a given column.but working with multiple column require moe Ios.
PRO & COns
Row-Based
Optimal  for read/write
good for OLTP
Compression isn;t efficient
Aggregation isn't efficientEfficient queries
W/multi-columns
Column-Based 
Writes are slower
OLAP
Compress greatly
Amazing for aggregation 
Innefficient queries W/multi-columns

 the ENGINE clause is used when creating a table to specify the storage engine that will be used to store and manage the table's data. The storage engine is responsible for determining how the data is organized and accessed, as well as how it is compressed and optimized for performance.

The ENGINE clause is followed by the name of the storage engine that will be used. ClickHouse supports a variety of storage engines, including:

MergeTree: a column-oriented storage engine optimized for OLAP workloads that involve large amounts of data and complex queries.
Memory: a storage engine that stores all data in memory and is optimized for fast read and write performance, but is not suitable for large datasets or long-term storage.
TinyLog: a simple log-based storage engine that is suitable for small datasets or for testing and experimentation.
Log: a more complex log-based storage engine that supports multiple replicas and is optimized for high availability and fault tolerance.
Other storage engines are also available, such as ReplacingMergeTree, Distributed, MaterializedView, and more. Each engine has its own set of properties and configuration options that can be specified when creating the table.
eg.
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id UInt32,
  name String,
  date Date
) ENGINE = MergeTree(date, (id, date), 8192)
In this example, the table my_table has three columns (id, name, and date) and is using the MergeTree engine with the date 
column specified as the primary key and the (id, date) columns specified as the sorting key. The final parameter 8192 is the
 block size in bytes used by the engine.

"key point we can change the size of granules by using setting clause  " which can can help 
to optimize the query as per need a eaxmple for this given below

SELECT column, sum(value) FROM my_table GROUP BY column  //with default size (8192 kilobyte(kb))  here granule have 8192 column
SELECT column, sum(value) FROM my_table SETTINGS merge_tree_minimal_block_size=67108864, merge_tree_max_block_size=67108864 GROUP BY column
// with size of 64mb here the granule 67108864 column
