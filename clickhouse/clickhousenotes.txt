Row-Oriented Database
Tables are stored as rows in disk
A single block io read to the table fetches multiple rows
with all their columns.
More IOs are required to find a particular row in a table
scan but once you find the row you get all columns for that
row.
Column_Oriented Database
Tables are sorted as columns first in disk
a single block io read to the table fetches multiple columns with all matching rows
less IOs are required to get more values of a given column.but working with multiple column require moe Ios.
PRO & COns
Row-Based
Optimal  for read/write
good for OLTP
Compression isn;t efficient
Aggregation isn't efficientEfficient queries
W/multi-columns
Column-Based 
Writes are slower
OLAP
Compress greatly
Amazing for aggregation 
Innefficient queries W/multi-columns
