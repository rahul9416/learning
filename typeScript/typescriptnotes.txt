FORMAL DEFINATION
TypeScript is a programming language and a superset 
of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and 
other features to JavaScript. It was developed by
Microsoft and released in 2012. TypeScript provides
features such as type annotations, interfaces, classes, 
and modules, which enable developers to write more
maintainable and scalable code. It also has better
tooling and IDE support than JavaScript, which can
improve productivity and catch errors early in the development process. 
TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript, which means that it can run on any JavaScript runtime, such as a web browser or a Node.js server. It has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially for large-scale web applications.
